This file is left intentionally empty by default to be backwards compatible with the initial theme setup.

Although the theme has advanced a little bit and it now allows to specify the content on the main page (even if the list of posts/articles is not intended).
This can be:
- with the list of posts/articles (default: `mainSections = ["post"]) or
- without the list of posts/articles (by setting `mainSections = [""]`)

Markdown supported, ie:

```
# Welcome

Remember that you can also specify a section header for the posts below by configuring the `mainSectionsTitle` parameter in the front matter of this file.

# About me

I'm a Melbourne girl who loves big cities and beach life in equal measure. I've called London home, and Torquay too (the Aussie one). Right now, you can find me living life in Auckland.

I like making things. I play music, take photos, and write words.

I enjoy drinking great coffee. I am an enthusiastic dancer.

I believe in perpetual learning. I practice wide curiosity.

I thrive on the uncertainty that comes with starting something new. I have developed a strange kind of affection for feeling uncomfortable.

All I really want is to live a full and interesting life. I think I'm doing a pretty good job so far :)
