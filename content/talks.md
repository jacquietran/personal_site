title: About
---

I'm a Melbourne girl who loves big cities and beach life in equal measure. I've called London home, and Torquay too (the Aussie one). Right now, you can find me living life in Auckland.

I like making things. I play music, take photos, and write words.

I enjoy drinking great coffee. I am an enthusiastic dancer.

I believe in perpetual learning. I practice wide curiosity.

I thrive on the uncertainty that comes with starting something new. I have developed a strange kind of affection for feeling uncomfortable.

All I really want is to live a full and interesting life. I think I'm doing a pretty good job so far :)
